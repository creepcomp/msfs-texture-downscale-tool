# MSFS Texture Downscale Tool (v1.1)

## Overview

The **MSFS Texture Downscale Tool** is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) tool designed to help Microsoft Flight Simulator (MSFS) addon creators and users easily manage and downscale high-resolution `.dds` textures. The tool detects large textures (above 8K resolution) and allows you to resize them to a target resolution (default 4K) for better performance and compatibility with MSFS.

Version: **v1.1**

---

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Simple and intuitive interface built with Tkinter.
- **Texture Detection & Listing:** Automatically scans selected directories for `.dds` textures and displays them in a table with their name and resolution.
- **Texture Downscaling:** Resizes high-resolution textures to a manageable size (4K or lower) while preserving important details.
- **Adaptive Resolution Handling:** Handles textures above 32K by scaling down to 16K and textures between 16K and 8K by scaling to 8K, before downscaling to 4K.
- **Progress Tracking:** Displays progress via a progress bar during texture processing.
- **Folder Selection & Scanning:** Easy folder selection to locate textures and scan them efficiently.
- **Clear Button:** Clears the list of textures and resets the state.
- **Error Handling:** Handles errors while reading or processing files and shows informative messages.
